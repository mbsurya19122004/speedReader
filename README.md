# speedReader

this is a stupid recreational coding project i made because i was curious how speed reading apps work.

there was no grand plan, no productivity goal, no startup idea. i just wanted to see if i could make text display one word at a time in the browser and mess around with timing, DOM manipulation, and focus positioning.

it exists purely because curiosity exists.

## what it does

it shows words one at a time.

that's it.

the idea is based on speed reading techniques where instead of moving your eyes across text, the text moves to your eyes. theoretically this reduces eye movement and lets you read faster. whether it actually makes you smarter is debatable.

## why i made this

mostly to learn and experiment with:

* javascript timing (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
* DOM manipulation
* splitting and handling text
* positioning letters precisely
* and just building something small for fun

also because making useless things is one of the best ways to learn useful things.

## how to run

clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/mbsurya19122004/speedReader.git
cd speedReader
```

open `index.html` in your browser.

no install, no dependencies, no nonsense.

## project structure

```
index.html    main page
script.js     logic
```

## current state

works. technically.

not polished. not optimized. not pretty.

but it does the thing.

## future plans

maybe improve it. maybe abandon it. maybe rewrite it in rust for no reason. who knows.

## conclusion

this project serves no real purpose other than satisfying curiosity.

but curiosity is the engine of everything interesting humans have ever done, so that's good enough.
